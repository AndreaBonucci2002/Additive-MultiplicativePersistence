# Additive-MultiplicativePersistence
-Calculates the additive and multiplicative persistence chain.


-For example: The additive persistence of 2718 is 2: first we find that 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18, and then that 1 + 8 = 9. The multiplicative persistence of 39 is 3, because it takes three steps to reduce 39 to a single digit: 39 → 27 → 14 → 4. Also, 39 is the smallest number of multiplicative persistence 3.


-"277777788888899" is the number with the longest multiplicative persistence we know of.
